## System Introduction
What we built is a shopping system on which customers could buy sports-related products, and managers have the accessibility to manage the transaction made by customers as well as customers’ information.
There two types of users in our system which are ‘Customer’ and ‘Manager’. These two types of customers will have to register in our system first to access the system. Our website provides a series of basic functions for customers, including logging in, logging out, viewing and modifying customer profile, searching products, browsing products, adding products to the shopping cart, placing orders, as well as viewing history orders, etc. Moreover, managers are responsible to manage the users, products, transactions, employees, real stores and suppliers information. For senior managers who need to know the big picture of the sales performance, detailed numbers and charts can be provided for deep analysis and exploration.
